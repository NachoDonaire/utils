# project-initializer

This pretends to be an alias to initialize a CPP project with a Makefile, src and inc directories. All you have to do is to clone this, add the following line to your .zshrc or .bashrc:

```bash
alias project-initializer='project-initializer.sh'
```

then, move or copy the project-initializer script into your /usr/bin directory.

Finally, you will have to run the following command from your home directory:

```bash
source .zshrc
```

and now, all is ready to enjoy your cpp project initializer.
